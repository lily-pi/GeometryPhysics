# Introduction

The **Geometry Dash Physics Project** (GDPP) is an initiative to document the internals and functions of the Geometry Dash physics engine, including:

* Mathematical constants
* Internal functions
* Computative approaches

It is currently managed by a single person, and has a lot of work to do.

# Gravity

The gravity constant, $$g$$, varies between game modes.

## Cube

In the cube mode, there are two forms of gravity:

* Standard
* Inverted (Upside-Down)

The _Inverted_ mode works identically to the standard mode, simply substituting the acceleration constant for its additive inverse, $$-g$$. The standard acceleration is $$-72b/s^2$$, which can be then computed by block with respect to time with the following formula:

$$
h_{\mathrm{b}}(t) = h_0 - \int_{0}^{t} \int_{0}^{\tau} 79 \; \mathrm{d}\phi \mathrm{d}\tau = h_0 - \frac{79t^2}{2} = h_0 - 39.5t^2
$$

Which is obtained by integrating the acceleration twice, as the acceleration is the second derivative. Here, $$h_0$$ represents the initial height in blocks. One can compute change in generic height using the following conversion metric:

$$
1\cdot \mathrm{b}^1 = 30\cdot \Delta^1
$$

Thus, the height in terms of the $$\Delta$$ unit is

$$
h_\Delta(t) = h_0 - 1185t^2
$$

Where $$h_0$$ is in terms of the Delta unit.

Similarly, the height in pixels is

$$
h_{\mathrm{p}}(t)=h_0 - 5332.5t^2
$$

With $$h_0$$ in pixels. However, the acceleration is piecewise, and will turn constant after a certain interval:

$$
h_{\mathrm{b}}(t) = 
\left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
        h_0 - 39.5t^2, & \text{if } a_y > -30.1194 \\
        0 & \text{if } a_y \le -30.1194
    \end{array}
\right\}
$$

Here, $$a_y$$ is the vertical acceleration in $$\mathrm{b}^1 \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1}$$.

## Ship

In the ship mode, there are two modes of gravity:

* Normal
* Inverse

The inverse simply inverts the acceleratory constant with $$-g$$ instead of $$g$$.

The standard acceleration in the ship mode is $$-25b/s^2$$, which is considerably slower than the cube. The formulae are given:

$$
h_{\mathrm{b}}(t) = h_0 = 12.5t^2
$$

$$
h_{\Delta}(t) = h_0 - 375t^2
$$

$$
h_{\mathrm{p}}(t) = h_0 - 1687.5t^2
$$
